# ContactBook

This project evaluates my understanding and implementation of an ASP.NET Core API. The goal is to create a Contact-book API with the following features:

Identity membership system
Cloudinary integration for photo storage
Pagination
Swagger-UI for API access visualization
JWT authentication
Choice of SqlLite or SQL-Server database
EFCore and LINQ for data access
The API includes endpoints for CRUD operations on user records:

GET: /User/all?page=[current number]
GET: /User/[id]
GET: /Search?term=[search-term]
POST: /User/add
PUT: /User/update/[id]
DELETE: /User/delete/[id]
PATCH: /User/photo/[id]
This project demonstrates proficiency in ASP.NET Core API development.
